      'In Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, residents have been shouting “Wuhan jiayou” meaning, “Wuhan, stay strong” out of their windows, from apartment building to apartment building, to send words of encouragement to fellow citizens, doctors and medical staff at the front lines of the battle. When facing a crisis, humans historically seek solidarity. \n\nCommunity solidarity is often seen as a great way for the community to feel alive and charged with energy after facing hard times. As the 11 million citizens in Wuhan entered the sixth day under lockdown because of the coronavirus, people have been forced to stay indoors to limit their contact with others. As fears grew, some felt the need to boost morale and create a sense of community solidarity. \n\nIn addition to raising morale and giving a strong sign of life to a city that has been rendered a ghost town, the "jiayou"  chants have also served another purpose: For the global media audience, it has helped to humanise the citizens of Wuhan.';
